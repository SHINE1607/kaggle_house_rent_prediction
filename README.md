**kaggle_house_rent_prediction**

==> the problem was a regression analysis to predict the house rent
==> The data matrix had 1460*80 train dimension, of 1460 samples and 80 features
==> Dimesnsion of the data matrix soared to 191 after categorical encoding of data
==> the algorithm uses the method of PCA to deccrease the dimensionality from 191 to 163 decreasing noise and extracting the 95% of the variance 
==> The regression techniques used are xgboost Regressor and as simple Artificial neural network conatining 2 hidden layers
